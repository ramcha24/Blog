    <p>Hello there! This is my first blog post. Over the years, I have taken some classes, skipped few lectures, read a couple of books, also had the usual amount of human and computer interactions. As a result, I have formulated some opinions, styles and preferences. I seem to take notes in a certain way when I read. I seem to process information in a certain way. I would like to think its unique, but even if not, I think its an expression of personality in itself. Now looking at it in a meta-way, it feels like a creative process to go through my understanding and put it into words.</p>

<p>My thoughts and personality will dynamically evolve with every new experience. So I might contradict myself later on what I find to not be interesting. Usually at some point in future I realise that something I didn’t pay attention too earlier was actually quite fascinating. So any dismissive ideas are to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a Msc in Mathematics and B.E. in Computer Science (yes at the same time and in parallel) from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. BITS has its own distinctive stlye of education, opportunities and trapdoors. It has given me the both chance and punishment of learning extremely varied topics. I actually had a semester where I was required to do “Functional Analysis” ,a very abstract of Mathematics course and “MicroProcessors and Interfacing” , a very practical Computer Science course. At some point I went berserk and lost the plot trying to switch moods and stick to their schedules and evaluations.</p>

<p>But, both of them were quite interesting and my real regret is I could have done more justice to them. I want to escape from the predictable schedule and sequence of a college student - lectures, anxiety, tests, relief,  grades, sadness. So here I am, I have chosen to just read and learn what I can and feel like and ensure that I satisfy myself on the little things that I do learn and not the entire bunch I am supposed to.</p>

<p>Off we go…</p>

<p>(a^2 + b^2 = c^2) –&gt; note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping!</p>
